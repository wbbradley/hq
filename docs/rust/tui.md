# Pure TUI model and rendering contract

Status: Active pure-client contract

`hq-tui` owns deterministic presentation state and borrowed Ratatui rendering. It does not own a
terminal, clock, task runtime, local connection, storage handle, signer, filesystem, process, or
domain mutation capability. The outer `hq-node` composition normalizes ordinary local API
observations into the closed event vocabulary and executes returned effects. Its Crossterm shell
adds terminal input and resize normalization plus exclusive Ratatui rendering ownership.

## Transition boundary

The only behavioral entry point is:

```text
UiModel + UiEvent -> Result<(UiModel, [UiEffect]), UiError>
```

`UiEvent` covers one-time startup, normalized input, complete resizes, identity-bearing timer and
snapshot completions, revision-only invalidations, and generation-scoped connection states and
failures. `UiEffect` covers section-bound complete-snapshot requests, timers, redraw requests, and
exit. The transition function performs no I/O and has no domain mutation port.

Every asynchronous request receives a nonzero process-local `EffectId`. A completion changes state
only while that exact identity is outstanding for its effect kind. Older snapshot successes and
failures cannot overwrite a newer snapshot or connection state, and an elapsed timer cannot run
twice. Invalidation revisions coalesce into one greatest required revision. If an in-flight
snapshot is older than that requirement, its matching completion schedules one follow-up request;
it is never treated as current merely because the request succeeded. Connection observations obey
the shell's monotonic generation.

The model preserves selection by stable row identity, not by screen coordinate or vector index.
Reload keeps the selected identity when it remains present and selects the first logical row when
it disappears. Resize changes dimensions only; it does not rewrite logical focus or selection.

## Reconnecting client and effect executor

`hq-node::LocalNodeEventClient` is the long-lived subscribed form of the ordinary local API client.
Its bounded poll distinguishes an idle socket from a disconnect, and its Unix connection retains an
incremental frame decoder so a read timeout cannot discard a partial frame. Reconnect delays remain
queued against monotonic deadlines across short shell polls. Every negotiated generation registers
the broad invalidation subscription before its acknowledged authoritative snapshot is exposed.

`LocalTuiClient` maps only complete authoritative local API snapshots into the exact requested
`UiSection`. The protocol `AuthoritativeSnapshotDto` and presentation `UiSnapshot` are deliberately
different records: one is canonical local-API data, while the other is a small section-specific
view containing only safe rendering fields. Neither is a storage compatibility shape, and both
passive records expose their fields directly.

`TuiEffectExecutor` owns one named worker and bounded command/result channels. The worker alone owns
the subscribed client; the shell cannot reach storage, domain planners, signers, relays, providers,
or files through this boundary. The executor preserves snapshot effect identity, releases each
timer once, coalesces redraw requests, and joins its worker on explicit shutdown or drop. Shutdown
drains bounded results while enqueueing the stop command, so saturated queues cannot deadlock the
join. Client failures and connection observations retain their generation so older results cannot
overwrite newer UI state.

## Data and encapsulation

Shell-normalized snapshots, rows, sizes, and failures are passive records and expose public fields.
Their text is bounded and sanitized before entering this crate. There is no accessor facade around
those DTOs.

`UiModel` is not a passive record. It keeps the outstanding snapshot and timer identities aligned
with minimum revisions, reconnect generations, retry state, selection, and one-time startup/exit
state. Its fields therefore remain private and it exposes only observations needed by the shell,
renderer, and tests. `EffectId` likewise hides construction so zero or shell-invented identities
cannot enter a transition.

## Borrowed rendering and layouts

`render(Frame, &UiModel)` only borrows the complete model. It cannot update the model or invoke a
capability. Tests clone the model around every render and compare deterministic terminal buffers.

The first responsive layouts are semantic Rust-era layouts, not Bubble Tea compatibility:

- at least 96 columns: persistent left section navigation and a content pane;
- 40 through 95 columns: compact horizontal section navigation above content;
- below 40 columns or 10 rows: a bounded resize message that retains the quit hint.

The header reports the selected section, connection state, and authoritative revision. Rows expose
selection, stable presentation state, and bounded detail. The footer exposes discoverable controls
or the latest stable failure code and operator action. Styling supplements these text markers and
is not the sole carrier of state.

## Shell obligations

The terminal/client shell must:

1. send `Started` once and preserve the returned model between events;
2. normalize keys, resize observations, connection state, snapshots, and invalidations before
   calling the transition function;
3. execute effects outside `hq-tui` and return the exact effect identity on completion;
4. use the ordinary local API for snapshots and mutations, with no direct storage or domain side
   channel;
5. allocate monotonically increasing connection generations and ignore no model-requested retry;
6. coalesce redraw work without dropping the latest model; and
7. restore terminal state through shell-owned RAII on every exit path.

Terminal ownership, key-event decoding, event-loop composition, and restoration remain outside the
pure crate in `hq-node`. `TerminalGuard` is armed before activation so partial activation, normal
quit, Ctrl-C, terminal errors, client-worker failure, and panic unwinding all attempt restoration
exactly once. Restoration reverses cursor hiding, mouse capture, alternate-screen ownership, and
raw mode and is idempotent. The shell reaches state only through `TuiEffectExecutor`; reconnect
execution and snapshot mapping are composed there.

The installed `hq tui` role accepts only human output with both stdin and stdout attached to a
terminal. A bare `hq` selects the same role when both streams are terminals and retains the
noninteractive `list` role otherwise. The binary returns from the guarded shell before translating
failure into a process exit, so it never exits while terminal modes are still owned.
