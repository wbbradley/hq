# HQ Rust Rewrite

## Goal

Build a clean-sheet Rust implementation of HQ that satisfies
`rust-rewrite-design.md`, the reviewed Rust-era specifications produced by this plan, and the
acceptance matrix in that design. Preserve the distributed causal-fact model and its algebraic
laws. Do not preserve Go databases, canonical schemas, local RPC, command syntax, package
boundaries, UI details, or other compatibility merely because the Go implementation has them.

The autonomous work ends with a verified, cutover-ready Rust release candidate and a rehearsed
operator procedure. Replacing, deleting, or disabling a live Go installation, activating a
production identity, and declaring a production soak successful require separate user authority.

## Authoritative sources

Use these sources in order when they disagree:

1. The decisions, non-goals, invariants, acceptance matrix, and definition of done in
   `rust-rewrite-design.md`.
2. Rust-era specifications and ADRs created by this plan.
3. The algebraic laws currently recorded in `../crdt-algebra-laws.html` and then copied into the
   tracked Rust-era specifications.
4. Retained product intent extracted from `docs/`, `rust-port.md`, and
   `rust-port-transcript.md`.
5. Frozen Go code and tests as scenario sources and defect evidence, never as a compatibility
   oracle.

## Execution contract

- The ordered list under **Next Up** is the complete remaining roadmap, not merely the next task.
- Execute the first item with the `next-task` skill using the exact path
  `/Users/wbbradley/src/hq/PLAN.md`. After completing and recording it, continue with the new first
  item until the queue is empty.
- If the first item is too large for one coherent, reviewable commit, split it into smaller
  capability-named items at the front of the queue before implementation. Do not encode sequence
  positions in durable names.
- Refine later items as specifications and implementation reveal better boundaries. Add every
  newly discovered requirement, regression, recovery obligation, or acceptance gap to the queue at
  the correct dependency position. Never narrow or delete required scope except by completing it
  and recording it in `COMPLETED.md`.
- Use test-first development where practical. Keep domain policy pure, dependencies pointed inward,
  and I/O behind the boundaries in the rewrite design. Every task must leave the repository
  formatted, lint-clean, tested in proportion to its risk, and committed with a Conventional
  Commit.
- Resolve routine implementation choices autonomously. Choose the simplest first-principles option
  consistent with the architecture, security model, and retained behavior, and record material
  decisions as ADRs. Stop only for a decision that changes product scope or security posture,
  expands authority, requires destructive or externally consequential action, or remains genuinely
  irresolvable from evidence.
- Do not claim the goal complete merely because **Next Up** is empty. Audit every acceptance-matrix
  row and the definition of done in `rust-rewrite-design.md` against current evidence; add any
  missing work back to the queue and continue.

## Next Up

- **[verification/high] Close completion-evidence coverage gaps** — Expand the acceptance inventory
  so every required subclaim in each matrix row names direct current executable evidence, bind the
  definition-of-done recovery clause to identity/database, relay/provider, project-saga, and
  archived-Go rollback evidence, and add an explicit verifier proving normal Rust build/runtime
  inputs have no Go code, state, protocol, service, or toolchain dependency. Remove stale
  pre-implementation markers from normative Rust documents, and normalize the unshipped
  clean-sheet storage schema to v1 without a migration or compatibility path. Replace any yanked
  cryptographic dependency discovered by the final dependency audit. Complete this work only after
  the exact revision passes local gates and the native release workflow, independently downloaded
  artifacts reproduce the release, recovery, and cutover manifests, and a final requirement audit
  finds no weak or missing proof.
