### Expose runtime recovery status and schedule bounded retries

**Problem.** Durable assignment eligibility and device connectivity do not describe current agent
availability. Known-queued delivery is currently collapsed into acceptance uncertainty, and failed
recovery depends on later wake events rather than a bounded retry policy.

**Dependencies.** Requires exact project-session readiness before dispatch. Extend the project
workflow, node event scheduling, application/local API types and TUI together.

**Scope and invariants.**
- Expose stopped, starting, ready, working and blocked observations correlated with exact agent,
  assignment, provider/session and node-generation/worker-owner identities. Old readiness results
  must not establish current liveness; device connectivity remains a separate status.
- Preserve known-queued versus acceptance-unknown state through a scoped runtime outcome, workflow
  and client. Reconcile uncertain provider acceptance before retry; preserve submission identity,
  input sequence and durable messages.
- Coalesce recovery for an assignment/session and persist bounded transient retries with backoff
  across restart. Trigger on pending work at startup and process loss with outstanding work. Avoid
  recurring whole-state scans. An unexpired prior-owner lease must schedule a later attempt without
  bypassing ownership. Preserve typed failure reasons rather than collapsing every resume error into
  unavailable. Permanent failure/exhaustion exposes typed Retry and View details.
- Revalidate and fence against close, reassignment, retirement and ownership changes. Idle stopped
  assignments need not launch, and missing saved sessions never become fresh conversations silently.
- Render actionable progress such as “Alice is restarting · Your message is saved.” Publish
  body-free invalidations; exact runtime/recovery evidence belongs in details. Distinguish submission
  attempts, proven acceptance and uncertainty in traces, including recovery paths.

**Completion.** A full client journey assigns Alice, receives a reply, restarts HQ and sends another
message; the same conversation resumes and delivers once with truthful status. Cover pending work
before startup, process loss, permanent/transient resume failure, concurrent sends, close/reassignment
races, stale queued work, retry exhaustion/restart and lost acceptance responses. Update
`docs/projects.md` and `docs/harness-supervisor-v1.md` to describe targeted retries and observations.
